This C++ program solicits user input, expecting a sequence of letters and/or numbers. 
Upon receiving a string as input, the program utilizes it as a parameter to generate 
a pyramid pattern. The pattern is crafted through the implementation of two nested loops: 
an outer loop governs the rows, while an inner loop handles the printing of characters 
within each row. The distinctive pyramid shape emerges as characters are printed in 
ascending order, followed by a reverse sequence.
