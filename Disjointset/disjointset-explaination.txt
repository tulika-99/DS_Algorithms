A disjoint-set data structure is a data structure that keeps track of a set of 
elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
 A union-find algorithm is an algorithm that performs two useful operations on such a data structure:

Find: Determine which subset a particular element is in. 
This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.

Union: Join two subsets into a single subset.

In this post, we will discuss the application of Disjoint Set Data Structure. 
The application is to check whether a given graph contains a cycle or not.

Union-Find Algorithm can be used to check whether an undirected graph contains cycle or not. 
This is another method based on Union-Find. This method assumes that the graph doesn’t contain any self-loops.
We can keep track of the subsets in a 1D array, let’s call it parent[].
